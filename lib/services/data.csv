His other product was doing relatively well at that time (around $4k MRR). But as he started working on this feature, he realized that the potential for this was so huge, there wasn't any reason to limit it to his current customers. Anyone who has a website could make use of this. That’s when he decided to launch this feature as an entirely different product.","Building an entire chat platform was so much more difficult than the founder initially expected. At that time, this ChatGPT use case was not that popular and there were no resources available; so he built everything from scratch.

But he knew the problem was there, he had the UX that he wanted the users to experience. So decided to build a very bare minimum version of it in 2-3 weeks and launch it. The only feature it had was the core feature – you add your website link and then a chatbot will get created and trained on all the content on your website. That’s the only thing the chatbot did at the time of launch. The goal was to improve it later only if necessary. But it was important for the founder to launch it first and see if anyone would use it.
","During the pre-launch stage, the founder leveraged his 10K followers Twitter audience to share the process and attract some attention. Following this same strategy, his launch consisted in sharing a tweet. 

Within the first hour of launching he already had a few customers. Around 15k people visited his website that day.

A few days later, he also shared the project on Hacker News, where it also got a lot of attention and reached the front page.

","In the beginning, the website was shared on the Excel subreddit, which triggered its social virality. The website gained widespread attention on various social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit.
